how do i understand vision tranformer?

ChatGPT:

A Vision Transformer (ViT) is a type of neural network architecture that is commonly used for image classification tasks. It is based on the Transformer architecture, which was originally developed for natural language processing tasks.

In a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN), the image is processed using a series of convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from the image. In a Vision Transformer, the image is divided into a grid of patches, and each patch is flattened into a vector. These patches are then processed by a series of self-attention layers, which allow the network to attend to different parts of the image and learn spatial relationships between the patches.

The self-attention layers in a Vision Transformer operate on the flattened patch vectors and are designed to capture both local and global dependencies between the patches. This allows the network to learn features that are relevant to the task at hand, regardless of their spatial location in the image.

Once the patches have been processed by the self-attention layers, the resulting feature vectors are fed through a series of fully connected layers to produce the final classification output.

Overall, the Vision Transformer is a powerful and flexible architecture that can be used for a wide range of image classification tasks. However, it requires a large amount of training data and computational resources to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Comment:

Explains somewhat well, not very clear and not detailed enough, concepts like self attention and dependencies not explored.





Google (account and incognito had same links):

link 1: https://viso.ai/deep-learning/vision-transformer-vit/
More detailed but too much info and had to scroll for a short while to find more useful info.

link 2: https://theaisummer.com/vision-transformer/
not to cluttered with useless info and more to the point, but still not very easy to understand

link 3: https://www.v7labs.com/blog/vision-transformer-guide
detailed and covers the attention mechanism, seems better than link1 but still not very easy to unerstand.

when i type in "how do i understand vision tranformer?"

what appears is:
    There are no results for how do i understand vision tranformer?

comment: multiple links that have text in unknown language, few somewhat useful links




Conclusion: Google and ChatGPT are better than Bing, Google provides multiple options but user has to search out the useful data, ChatGPT provides direct answer but may not be detailed, however more questions can be asked to go into more details, but ChatGPT has a risk of giving wrong answers, which is a lesser risk using google, as the links provided are written and maintained by humans.
